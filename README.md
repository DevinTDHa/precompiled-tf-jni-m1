# precompiled-tf-jni-m1

Precompiled and packaged tensorflow for java. 

The jar [`tensorflow-core-platform-0.4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`](tensorflow-core-platform-0.4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) was shaded, so they include the other dependencies for tensorflow-java.

To download the jars, head to the [releases](https://github.com/DevinTDHa/precompiled-tf-jni-m1/releases).

Based on this branch: https://github.com/Craigacp/tensorflow-java/tree/apple-silicon
