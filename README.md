# precompiled-tf-jni-m1

Precompiled and packaged tensorflow for java. 

The jar `tensorflow-core-platform-0.4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` was shaded, so they include the other dependencies for tensorflow-java.

Please run the command `git lfs pull` on this repo to download the rather large jar files.

Based on this branch: https://github.com/Craigacp/tensorflow-java/tree/apple-silicon

Built on Macbook Air M1 (2020) on macOS Monterey.
